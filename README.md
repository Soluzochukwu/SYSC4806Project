## Project Description
The objective of the project is to create a web application for a perk manager system that allows a registered user to create a profile with all the subscriptions that they have. The user is able to search the system for available perks based on matches with their subscriptions, increasing/decreasing amount of votes or proximity to an expiry date. The user can also post new perks into the system and can upvote and downvote the perks depending on whether they find them useful. 

 
## Project Milestone 1 Goals
 - A user can sign up and create an account
 - A user can sign in once they have created an account
 - A user can add a perk and have it displayed in a table once signed in 
 - A user can add a subscription and have it displayed on a table
 
## Project Milestone 2 Goals
 - A user can remove a subscription and have the table dynamically be updated
 - A user can upvote or downvote a perk
 - A user or user without a profile can search for perks based on increasing/decreasing amount of votes
